# Santiagonasar's system setup scripts

My system setup scripts for Ubuntu / POP_OS 20.10.
Integrated with my dotfiles repo -  https://github.com/santiagonasar/dotfiles

Incomplete but working - still missing some configurations, VPN, keybindings. In the future it would be ideal to integrate with the dotfiles repo.

## Usage
1. Pull the repo
2. `./setup.sh` can initiatiate the installation sequence.
3. It will automatically download the dotfiles repo and create appropriate symlinks.
4. Logout and login.
5. Change font in the terminal to powerline patched one - I use `Deja Vu Powerline`
